[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the Virtual AI Keyboard project! This repository contains the code and resources for creating a virtual AI keyboard using Python and the OpenCV library.

## Overview

The Virtual AI Keyboard is a project that utilizes computer vision techniques to enable users to interact with a virtual keyboard using hand gestures. By tracking the user's hand movements using a webcam, the application translates these movements into keystrokes, effectively allowing users to type without a physical keyboard.

## Features

- Virtual keyboard interface displayed on the screen.
- Hand tracking using OpenCV's computer vision capabilities.
- Gesture recognition to simulate key presses.
- Customizable gestures for different keys.

## Demo

Insert a GIF or link to a video that demonstrates your virtual AI keyboard in action.
